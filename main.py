# IMPORTANT NOTE
# Continuous sections of one or more characters are known as substrings.
# Substrings are defined by their starting and ending indices:
# The starting index of a substring is the index of its first character, while the ending index is the first index which is not part of the substring

# for i in range(5): # Code below is repeated 5 times
#     # Code to be repeated
#     forward(50) # Indentation indicates code is inside the loop
#     left(45) # Still inside the for loop
# # No more indentation! Marks the end of the for-loop.

# The substring of this program is "boss"


# Another example(challenge 46)
# word = "climb"

# word = "steamer"

# i = 1
# j = 6
# str2 = str1[i:j]
# print(str2) # Output: "crump"

# Another Example of how to get a slice(challenge 50)
# Another way to slice strings is to access every character before or after an index.
# You can access every character after the starting index by leaving out the ending index.
# To get âequivocalâ from the string "Unequivocal" stored in str1, you can just write str1[2:]:

# str1 = "Unequivocal"
# str2 = str1[2:]
# print(str2)

# The output is "equivocal"



# Another example(challenge 51)
# Similarly, we can get every character before the selected index by leaving out the starting index:
# str1 = "Goldfish"
# str2 = str1[:4]
# print(str2)

# The output of this program is "Gold"

# Solve this challenge(challenge 57)
# Suppose that we want to make a message incomprehensible by switching around all the vowels. âWe want bananasâ, for instance, might become âWa went benenesâ
# The first step in this process is to replace all aâs with eâs and all eâs with aâs.

# sentence = "a breakfast for billy the bee is an early egg"
#
# # sentence = sentence.replace("e", "a")
# sentence = sentence.replace("e", "@")
# # sentence = sentence.replace("a", "b")
# sentence = sentence.replace("a", "e")
# sentence = sentence.replace("@", "a")
# #sentence = sentence.replace("b", "e")

# print(sentence)

# Similar program like just above but different approach
# Defining a custom function named "left_turn"
# def left_turn():
#     # Start of left_turn's definition
#     for i in range(10):
#         forward(15)

# Similar challenge, just that now the function is just above the code
# This is the function call.

# This approach doesn't work because the function is called before defined.

# Here's a program that defines a new function â petal. Notice how petal references the previously defined left_turn
#
# hideturtle()

# # This is the definition of left_turn, as before.
# def left_turn():

# # This is definition of petal
# def petal():

# For this lesson, we've used the term arguments. Technically, this isn't quite right.
# In a function definition, the contents of the brackets are called parameters, not arguments. It's a small but subtle distinction


# Example of parameter:
# def circle(radius): # here radius is a parameter

# Exampe of argument:
# circle(20) # here 20 is an argument
